Open hardware development provides a collaborative and transparent framework that promotes knowledge and methodology sharing. This development encourages interdisciplinary collaboration for the creation of innovative and reliable devices and approaches, ensuring the validity of research protocols and findings.
</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
However, replicating open source devices could be time consuming or even requires a specific set of skills to implement despite clear open documentation. Open Source companies then offer consulting and manufacturing services for the installation and operation of these devices.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
At the Tuebingen meeting, we will present various open source hardware devices dedicated to visual neuroscience research and education:</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Combining 2P imaging with additional light stimulation – for example for visual stimulation or for driving optogenetic actuators – has remained challenging because the stimulation light can interfere with fluorescence detection. This can result in light artefacts in the image and/or may damage sensitive fluorescence detection equipment (e.g. photomultiplier tubes, PMTs).
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
A temporal separation between light stimulation and fluorescence detection, for example during the scan-retrace, can ameliorate these problems. This problem can be readily solved electronically, for example through use of a microcontroller.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Here, we present such a solution. Our system can line-synch up to 24 independent LED channels, and can be assembled from off-the-shelf components for substantially below $100. This provides for flexible options of spectrally diverse light stimulation during 2-photon scanning and comfortably provides sufficient power to drive standard optogenetics actuators such as CsChrimson.
