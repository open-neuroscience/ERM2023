Open hardware development provides a collaborative and transparent framework that promotes knowledge and methodology sharing. This development encourages interdisciplinary collaboration for the creation of innovative and reliable devices and approaches, ensuring the validity of research protocols and findings.
</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
However, replicating open source devices could be time consuming or even requires a specific set of skills to implement despite clear open documentation. Open Source companies then offer consulting and manufacturing services for the installation and operation of these devices.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
At the Tuebingen meeting, we will present various open source hardware devices dedicated to visual neuroscience research and education:</p>

<h4 align="left"> LED Zappelin': An Open Source and versatile LED controller for arbitrary spectrum visual stimulation and optogenetics during two-photon imaging. </h4>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Combining two-photon imaging with additional light stimulation – for example for visual stimulation or for driving optogenetic actuators – has remained challenging because the stimulation light can interfere with fluorescence detection. This can result in light artefacts in the image and/or may damage sensitive fluorescence detection equipment.
</p>

<img align="left" width="300" src="./assets/img/retrace.png"/>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
A temporal separation between light stimulation and fluorescence detection, for example during the scan-retrace, can ameliorate these problems. This problem can be readily solved electronically, for example through use of a microcontroller.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Here, we present such a solution. Our system can line-synch up to 24 independent LED channels, and can be assembled from off-the-shelf components for substantially below $200. This provides for flexible options of spectrally diverse light stimulation during two-photon scanning and comfortably provides sufficient power to drive standard optogenetics actuators such as CsChrimson.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The stimulator runs synchronous to the recording system using triggers generated by the FPGA-based DAQ. These signals correspond to scanning mirror retrace periods and are used to turn ON and OFF LEDs, thus avoiding swamping the PMTs by stimulation light.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
LED Zappelin' comes in two versions. One that can control user set LEDs, the second can be linked to external light generator such as the <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=13597">Thorlabs Chrolis system </a>
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
LED Zappelin' comes with a dedicated GUI, which allow intuitive control over the device.
Stimulus can be designed, pre-visualised

Following our previous <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48779">publication</a>, we here present a device which combines two <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=13597">Thorlabs Chrolis </a>
light sources and one <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/dlpu011f/dlpu011f.pdf?ts=1692029634948">DLP LightCrafter 4500</a>. User can then choose to combine 3 to 6 distinct chromatic light sources out of 12.
